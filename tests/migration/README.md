## Migration Benchmark:

### The following test was performed using a laptop with the configuration below:

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2500U with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx (8) @ 2.000GHz
* GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile 4GB 
* RAM: 16 GB

First of all, you have to compile the code to generate the executables. Make sure you're inside the run folder.

```console
SeisFAT3D/run$ ./program -compile
```

After that, you just need to perform the test.

```console
SeisFAT3D/run$ ./program -test_migration
```
The results will appear in .png images, as follows
